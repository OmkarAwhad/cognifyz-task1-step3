🌟 Day 3: Web Development Journey at Cognifyz Technologies 💻✨

Continuing my Web Development Internship, I successfully completed Task 1: HTML Structure and Basic Server Interaction – Step 3: Create Server-Side Endpoints to Handle Form Submissions! 🎯

This step introduced me to the fundamentals of creating server-side endpoints to handle form submissions, helping me understand how to process and manage data sent from the frontend.

🔥 Key Highlights

1️⃣ Frontend Form Creation 📄
- Designed a simple HTML form with fields for name and email.
- Utilized Tailwind CSS for styling to create a responsive and visually appealing form.

2️⃣ JavaScript for Form Submission 🚀
- Implemented JavaScript to handle form submission using the Fetch API.
- Sent form data to the backend server via a POST request.

3️⃣ Backend Server Setup 🛠️
- Created an Express.js server to handle form submissions.
- Set up a POST endpoint to receive and process form data.
- Configured CORS and body-parser middleware for smooth data handling.

4️⃣ Project Structure 📁
- Organized the project files with a proper .gitignore to exclude node_modules and environment files.
- Used npm scripts for running the development server.

🌱 Learning Outcomes
✅ Strengthened my understanding of handling form submissions and processing data on the server-side.
✅ Explored the Fetch API for making HTTP requests from the frontend.
✅ Gained hands-on experience in setting up and managing server-side endpoints with Express.js.
